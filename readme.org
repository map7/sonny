* Nodebot notes

** Stack

Robot:  arduino + firmata
Server: node + firmata (standard) + johnny-five

Firmata - coms
: npm i johnny-five express socket.io keypress

Use File -> examples -> firmata -> standard
Now close Arduino as you only need that for firmata.

** Issues

Couldn't connect or see servo objects (note you will not see five as an object)
Solution: reload firmata on the board & wait a good 10sec after done.
