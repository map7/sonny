* Nodebot notes

** IP

10.1.1.195 (ref: robots.org)

** Stack

Robot:  arduino + firmata
Server: node + firmata (standard) + johnny-five

Get the latest nodebots au firmata from https://github.com/nodebotsau/simplebot
In the directory SimpleBotFirmata, load this onto your arduino
Connect Arduino, wait a while, load the arduino app and upload

Firmata - coms
: npm i johnny-five express socket.io keypress

Use File -> examples -> firmata -> standard
Now close Arduino as you only need that for firmata.

** Running my robot

: node robot.js


** Issues

Couldn't connect or see servo objects (note you will not see five as an object)
Solution: reload firmata on the board & wait a good 10sec after done.

The left motor is not working correctly. Will have to get a replacement I think
